# Home Automation System Backend

This repository contains the backend configurations and integrations for a comprehensive Home Automation system. It is designed to manage and optimize various integrated systems across the home, ensuring efficiency, security, and automation. The core systems included in this repository are:

## Core Systems

1. **Heating and Energy Management**
   - **Room-Specific Heating Controls**: Manages heating for each room, allowing manual or automated to choose from.
   - **Nordpool Integration**: Optimizes heating schedules based on electricity price information.
   - **Energy Performance Analytics**: Analyzes energy consumption and cost relationships to measure heating system performance.
   - **User-Defined Variables**: Customizable settings for variables such as heating period, target temperature, and preheat planning.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**
   - **Indoor and Outdoor Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**: Real-time and historical data for optimal environmental control.
   - **Weather Forecasting**: Integrates outdoor temperature and weather data.
   - **Energy Consumption Tracking**: Tracks daily energy usage across the system.

3. **Security Systems**
   - **Alarm Management**: Control security alarms for risk detection and anomaly alerts.
   - **Security Unit Monitoring**: Monitors the status of security devices in the home.

4. **Water Leak and Humidity Detection**
   - **Water Leak Detection**: Alerts for significant water leaks in critical areas.
   - **Humidity Monitoring**: Tracks indoor humidity levels to detect anomalies and ensure comfort.

5. **IoT Monitoring and Anomaly Detection**
   - **Wireless IoT Backup**: Monitors IoT devices, keeping track of connectivity and performance.
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies issues such as sensor degradation or connectivity problems.
   - **Entity Health Monitoring**: Keeps track of the health and status of each IoT device, ensuring timely updates and maintenance alerts. This ensures that critical systems like heating, security, and energy monitoring remain fully functional.

6. **AI Integration**
   - **Cloud AI (OpenAI Integration)**: Uses OpenAI for natural language interpretation and performing actions in home automation system.
   - **Local AI (Llama 1160 Turbo LLM)**: On-premise AI for real-time processing and privacy-focused automation.

7. **Beta Integrations and Testing**
   - **Beta Integration Testing**: This system includes several experimental integrations that are being tested for future updates. These include new sensor types, machine learning models, and other IoT integrations that are being tested for stability and viability.
   - **Future Updates Tracking**: The repository is designed to keep track of ongoing beta tests, providing real-time feedback and logs about new features, updates, or changes in integrations. Users can opt-in to testing new features as they become available, contributing to further development.

8.  **System Integration**
   - **Modular Configuration**: The system supports various integrations, including third-party sensors, thermostats, and energy meters, providing flexibility for custom home automation setups.
   - **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to grow with your needs, the system can be extended to include new rooms, appliances, or devices as they are added to the home.

## Purpose

This backend configuration repository serves as the core of the home automation system. It is responsible for managing the heating system, integrating environmental data, calculating energy costs, running local AI for on-premise processing, leveraging cloud AI for advanced automation and natural language interaction, detecting water leaks and humidity issues, and monitoring wireless IoT devices for anomalies. The system also supports security features, AI-driven analysis, and automated adjustments for a seamless, energy-efficient, and user-friendly home environment.

## Getting Started

To use this system:
1. Clone the repository and deploy it on a compatible platform (e.g., Home Assistant).
2. Configure the integration settings for each room, sensor, and appliance.
3. Set up AI integration for local and cloud-based processing according to your preference.
4. Define heating schedules, electricity price limits, and other user-defined variables.
5. Set up water leak and humidity sensors to monitor critical areas.
6. Enable the IoT backup and anomaly detection system to keep track of device health.
7. Monitor system performance through analytics dashboards and adjust settings as needed.

## Notes

- Ensure that all entities, such as temperature sensors, thermostats, electricity meters, water leak sensors, and AI models, are correctly configured and linked.
- Cloud AI functionality requires an active OpenAI subscription and configuration of API keys for OpenAI access.
- Local AI processing with Llama 1160 Turbo LLM model is designed to operate independently of the cloud, ensuring low-latency, secure processing on local devices.
- Proper configuration of weather, energy, security, and water leak sensors is critical to ensuring system reliability and accurate data reporting.
- Custom automation scripts may require updates to align with your home's specific setup or local electricity pricing structures.
- The beta integrations are experimental and may require further testing.
