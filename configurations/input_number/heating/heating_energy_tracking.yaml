# Description:
# This configuration file contains three `input_number` entities used to track heating energy consumption over different time periods:
# - `hourly_heating_energy_tracking`: Tracks energy spent per hour in Wh.
# - `monthly_heating_energy_tracking`: Tracks total energy spent on heating for the current month in kWh.
# - `yearly_heating_energy_tracking`: Tracks total energy spent on heating for the current year in kWh.
#
# Each entity is updated by automation to reflect real-time energy usage, providing a detailed view of heating energy trends.
# This consolidated approach simplifies the configuration and enhances the tracking of energy usage over multiple periods, enabling better
# energy management and analysis of heating efficiency.
#
# Warning:
# Ensure that the automations responsible for updating these entities run correctly at appropriate intervals (hourly, daily, or yearly)
# to maintain accurate energy tracking for all periods.
