# Name: notify_weather_forecasts.yaml
# Author: Sebastian Sopola @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastiansopola/
# Description: This script sends weather forecast notifications to all users via mobile. The weather forecast message is dynamically retrieved from the AI's response stored in the `response_variable`.
#
# Usage: This script is called by an automation or function to notify users with the weather forecast at a specified time or event. IT will be possible to run this whenever asked to as well through voice audio interactions with AI.
#
# Warning: Ensure that the `response_variable` is correctly defined in the automation and contains valid weather data before triggering the script.
